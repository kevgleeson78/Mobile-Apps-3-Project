## Application outline:
This application is a 2D vertically scrolling shooter.<br/>
The object of the game is to survive as long as possible while getting the highest possible score.<br/>
After defeating 20 enemy ships the boss level is loaded.<br/>
Once the boss has been defeated the first level reloads with the enemy ships fireing a little faster. <br/>
This continues until the player has lost all of their lives.
